# Complete-Javascript-Course
Lessons from "The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert!" on Udemy

## Motivation
The motivation I had for putting this repo up was to have an example of the work that I have completed with Javascript and to have a
reference to the ideas and idiosyncrasies of the language put into action.

## Content
In this repo you will find a handful of small projects written in Javascript ranging from the very basics to some slightly more complex
ideas.
